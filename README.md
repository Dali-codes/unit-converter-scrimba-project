# Unit Converter - scrimba project
 
 The assignment was to create a unit converter with the given conversion values and design. 
 
 I´ve learned:
 
 - How to create a function to convert values in javascript
 - How to render out the values 
 
 These are the things I will improve at another stage:
 
 - Make it responsive
 - Modify the number input field so that is doesn´t take negative numbers 
 - Refactor the function
